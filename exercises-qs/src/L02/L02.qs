    /// of the array is a secret; you'll have to figure it out using Q#. The
    /// goal is to rotate each qubit around the Y axis by 15° (π/12 radians),
    /// multiplied by its index in the array.
    ///
    /// For example: if the array had 3 qubits, you would need to leave the
    /// first one alone (index 0), rotate the next one by 15° (π/12 radians),
    /// and rotate the last one by 30° (2π/12 = π/6 radians).
    ///
    /// # Input
    /// ## qubits
    /// The array of qubits you need to rotate.

    /// This investigates how to work with arrays and for loops in Q#, and how
    /// to use the arbitrary rotation gates.
